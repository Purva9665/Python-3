File 5 contains Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function. In this I used function called factorial which contains a variable named count to which i assigned value 1 as for factorial we need to multiply the numbers from 1 to the number of which we need the factorial. And i used for loop to calculate the factorial, as shown the output was that it should ask for a number first so after writing the function i asked for a sample number and then used this sample number to call the function at the last  
File 6 contains Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations. The output showed that first it should ask for a number and then give it's square root, log and sine value. i imported the maths module in python and imported all from it using '*'.I searched for 'python math maodule: maths method and their uses' there i got the module names and i used them assigning the number i asked earlier.
